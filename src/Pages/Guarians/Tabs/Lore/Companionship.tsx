      <h1>Companionship</h1>
      <p>
        The guarians are unique in that their existence does not seem to be self-contained. That is
        to say, a guarian has never been witnessed existing in solitude. Every observance of the
        guarians appears to have been, eventually, in the presence of another, for it appears the
        mere act of being perceived is how the guarians exist in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reliance upon being in the company of someone more real is not well understood, and
        their motives for behaving this way are completely unknown, but given the nature of these
        encounters, it appears as though their intent is purely just altruistic benevolence. The
        guarians seem to build a complex relationships, actively shaping themselves in strange ways
        in order to resonate with those they befriend
      </p>
      <h3>Understanding</h3>
      <p>
        Given their spiritual nature, their fantastical abilities and their completely inexplicable
        existence, one has to wonder what goes on within the mind of a guarian. Contrary to what one
        might think, it turns out that the answer is: probably not much. Unsurprisingly, usually
        lacking mouths, the guarians lack the ability to communicate, but it also seems like they
        only possess a rudimentary understanding of language in the first place.
      </p>
      <h3>Perception</h3>
      <p>
        Lacking eyes, the guarians do not see the world as we see it. Instead, the guarians seem to
        perceive things in their own unconventional way, somehow being able to sense the world
        around them.
