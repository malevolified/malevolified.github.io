        The guarians are unique in that their existence does not seem to be self-contained. That is
        to say, a guarian has never been witnessed existing in solitude. Every observance of the
        guarians appears to have been, eventually, in the presence of another, for it appears the
        mere act of being perceived is how the guarians exist in the first place.

        encounters, it appears as though their intent is purely just altruistic benevolence. The
        guarians seem to build a complex relationships, actively shaping itself in strange ways in
        order to resonate with those that it befriends
